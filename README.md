# CAFTA-Patch-2021

See PDF guide for patch details and use instructions

This patch adds a utility script that registers the CAFTA libraries called by the spreadsheet. 
The spreadsheet macro has been edited to save the result text file directly to the CAFTA install folder. Its Declare function now calls the library file path explicitly.
